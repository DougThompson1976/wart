lisp is old. these aren't mccarthy's reasons for building it. they're the
reasons I attribute to its power.

Keep programs small.
Divide program into pieces.
Create new pieces at any time.
Create pieces in any order.
Provide pieces with parameters. [Fewer pieces => Keeps programs small]
Use basic primitives.
Specify semantics for new pieces using primitives.
Invoke pieces to perform their semantics.
Communicate semantics to other programmers using test scenarios.
Invoke pieces with other pieces as arguments.
Make the piece being invoked obvious to identify.
