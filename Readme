  If I look at any small part of it, I can see what is going on -- I don't
  need to refer to other parts to understand what something is doing.

  If I look at any large part in overview, I can see what is going on -- I
  don't need to know all the details to get it.

  Every level of detail is as locally coherent and as well thought-out as any
  other level.

Wart is a small, *super* readable, thoroughly unit-tested lisp.
Wart returns to the roots of lisp: no constraints, maximum flexibility, extreme late-binding.
Wart is not a platform. It exposes no interface, releases no version numbers.
Anything can change at any time. If you use it, write lots of tests. Or God help you.
Everything is open to question -- but you'll have to pry macros out of my cold dead hands.

Wart is intended above all to be read.
If you write programs using it, put them in this directory. Don't hide it away
somewhere in your path.
Feel free to make changes to the language. You know your needs best.

Wart will eventually be 'fast enough'. Right now it's 3-5 orders of magnitude too slow.
It will always be small. 10-20kLoC should provide a useable foundation for 'real' apps.

Code sample:

  def fact(n)
    if (iso n 0)
      1
      (* n (fact (- n 1)))

  ; Alternatively
  def fact(n)
    (* n (fact (- n 1)))
  def fact(n) :case (iso n 0)
    1

The implementation uniformly uses stepwise refinement (aka monkey-patching) to
separate concerns. All language primitives can be extended (or even redefined).

  def len(x) :case (isa len queue)
    (queue-length x)

Other key features: first-class macros (fexprs), pervasive python-style
keyword args, and it can deduce parens from indentation (but
lisp-with-all-parens will always work).

You'll need linux and gcc.

To run it:
  $ wart
  wart>

Hit <enter> twice to eval.
Hit ctrl-d to quit.

To run tests:
  $ wart test
  $ # success

Wart started out as a common lisp implementation, which may be an easier read
if you aren't fluent with C: http://github.com/akkartik/wart/tree/sbcl

--- Paren-insertion based on indentation

Wart is indentation sensitive. Multi-token lines without leading parens are
implicitly grouped with later indented lines.

  if (> n 0)
    * n (- n 1)
  => (if (> n 0)
       (* n (- n 1))

Lines with a single token are never wrapped in parens:
  def foo()
    x
  => (def foo() x)    ; x is returned as a value, never called

Lines with a leading paren are never wrapped in parens:
  def foo(x)
    (prn x) x
  => (def foo(x) (prn x) x)

Putting these rules together, parens are not required around 'if' in:
  if (iso 1 (% x 2))
    'odd
    'even
..but they are required in:
  (if                 ; parens required because line has a single token
    (iso 1 (% x 2))   ; parens required to avoid grouping with next line
      'odd
    :else             ; optional; more clear
      'even)
..and furthermore, this is wrong:
  if (iso 1 (% x 2)
    'odd
  :else
    'even
  => (if (iso 1 (% x 2)) 'odd)
     (:else 'even)

By convention I try to leave out parens for control flow operators like def
and if and while, and keep parens around expressions. But there are exceptions
where parens are required, like with 'if' sometimes like above, and with 'do'
blocks:
  (do
    something
    something else)
  => (do something (something else))

Arglists are special:
  def foo(a b c
      d e f) ; this line's indentation doesn't matter
    34
  => (def foo(a b c d e f) 34)
Parens in the middle of a line disable paren-insertion until they are closed.

There are lots more scenarios in parenthesize.test.cc if you want to practice.

Conventional, fully-parenthesized expressions should always work:
  (def foo() 34)
  (def foo()
    34)
One exception: multi-line top-level lists should wrap by exactly one extra
space to avoid grouping subsequent lines:
  (one really long
   lisp data list)

Tabs count as 2 spaces. Don't mix tabs and spaces.

--- Garbage collection

Wart frees up unused memory using reference-counting
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_counting). Every Cell tracks the
number of incoming pointers to it using a field called nrefs.

Wart must increment/decrement nrefs when saving a Cell inside another: in the
car or cdr, or inside a Table. Never assign to car or cdr or a Table key by
hand. Use an existing primitive: setCar, setCdr, set. They're thoroughly
tested.

Tests thoroughly audit nrefs using checkState, in order to detect errors as
soon as possible.

eval takes pains to increment the nrefs of *exactly* one Cell (the return
value) across all paths. Nested calls to eval decrement nrefs of the result
unless they return it. Structure other functions returning Cells the same way.

To implement operations in C, use the COMPILE_PRIM_FUNC macro.
COMPILE_PRIM_FUNC, like eval, is responsible for ensuring that the nrefs of
exactly one Cell is incremented across all paths.

If you hack on wart's cc files and forget to decrement nrefs you have a memory
leak. If you forget to increment nrefs you have something worse: a prematurely
garbage-collected cell that may now be used for something else entirely. Old
pointers to it can no longer rely on what it contains; they may clobber or try
to interpret arbitrary data as a string or a Table. All bets are off. Wart
tries to loudly detect this insidious class of error as immediately as
possible. Every time a Cell is freed it resets its pointers to NULL; when it's
reused its pointers are initialized to nil. If wart ever complains that it ran
across NULL, it means I or you forgot to decrement nrefs somewhere. All bets
are off.

--- Generated _lists

To run its tests wart needs a list of tests to run. It constructs such a list
on the fly during compilation. Several other places use the same trick. The
set of files to compile is auto-generated, as is the list of compiled
primitives wart knows about. You can add new COMPILE_PRIM_FUNC operators, or
entirely new code in files new or old, and they'll be automatically included
the next time you run wart.
