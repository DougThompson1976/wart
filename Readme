This thoroughly unit-tested interpreter takes wart off Common Lisp and makes
it a lisp-1 with syntactically, significant whitespace, fexprs and
case-sensitive symbols.

Still in progress. Factorial is a thousand times slower than in arc.

You'll need gcc.

To run:
  $ wart
  wart>
Hit <enter> twice to eval.
Hit ctrl-D to quit.

To run tests:
  $ wart test
  $ # success

Wart is indentation sensitive:
  def foo()
    34

Tabs count as 2 spaces. Don't mix tabs and spaces.

Multi-token lines without leading parens are implicitly grouped with later
indented lines. Lines with a single token are always left alone. So the '34'
above isn't a function call. And parens are required in:

  (do
    something)

Conventional, fully-parenthesized expressions should always work with any
reasonable indentation.
  (def foo() 34)
  (def foo()
    34)

One special-case: multi-line top-level lists should wrap by exactly one extra
space to avoid grouping subsequent lines:
  (one really long
   lisp data list)
