  If I look at any small part of it, I can see what is going on -- I don't
  need to refer to other parts to understand what something is doing.

  If I look at any large part in overview, I can see what is going on -- I
  don't need to know all the details to get it.

  Every level of detail is as locally coherent and as well thought-out as any
  other level.

Wart is a small, thoroughly unit-tested language with an emphasis on
readability and hackability. The primary goal is to be super easy to
understand and modify. Everything is extensible, and there is little that
can't be done as a library.

Here's factorial in wart:

  def fact(n)
    if (iso n 0)        # iso ('isomorphic') is wart's comparison function
      1
      (n * (fact n-1))

Parens are used for function calls, not grouping; ((f)) is not the same as (f).

Here's another way to define factorial:

  def fact(n)
    (n * (fact n-1))

  def fact(n) :case (iso n 0)
    1

All functions are generic and can be extended or overridden at any time. The
two definitions above could be in completely different files. The
implementation uniformly adds features to language primitives by extending
them in this manner. Related code stays together, and unrelated code in a
single function keeps from getting entangled together.

  def len(x) :case (isa x queue)
    (queue_length x)

Other features: full-strength lisp macros that can be similarly extended and
passed to other functions/macros without constraint, a cleaner syntax than
traditional lisp, and function calls that can always add keyword arguments for
readability.

  wart> 4-3
  1
  wart> def subtract(a|from b) a-b
  wart> subtract 4 3
  1
  wart> subtract 3 :from 4
  1

You'll need linux and gcc.

To install it:
  $ git clone http://github.com/akkartik/wart.git
  $ cd wart
  $ ./wart
  wart>

Type <enter> twice to run code at the prompt.
Hit ctrl-d to quit.

To run its tests:
  $ wart test
  $ # success

As a language, wart was inspired by Arc, a dialect of lisp:
