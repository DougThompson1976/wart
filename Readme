This thoroughly unit-tested interpreter takes wart off Common Lisp and makes
it a lisp-1 with fexprs and case-sensitive symbols. Still in progress. A
half-assed measurement found factorial in wart to be a thousand times slower
than in arc.

You'll need gcc.

To run:
  $ wart
  wart>
Hit ctrl-D to quit.

To run tests:
  $ wart test
  $ # success

Oh, and you can use syntactically-significant whitespace.
  def foo()
    34
Conventionally-indented lisp will still work.
  (def foo() 34)
  (def foo()
    34)

If you start skipping parens you may need to hit an extra <enter> at the repl
to trigger eval.
