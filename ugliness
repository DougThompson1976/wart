can't use ':' for ssyntax since it's used early in the lisp reader
can't compose *any* ssyntax with any package-interned symbol with a ':'.

inserting say prn^ requires a call-fn or call. still a single edit, though.

can't use dot with functions before they're defined

case-insensitive symbols. converting strings to syms loses information.

can't defover string because it's also a type. so we're stuck with a useless
function that can't handle symbols.

zap and or= multiply-eval their place
