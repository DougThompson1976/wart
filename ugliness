nested ,@ doesn't work yet: http://people.csail.mit.edu/alan/ftp/quasiquote-v59.ps.gz

can't always call macros with @args
macros need a special-cased eval to support @args
evalArgs != explicitly eval'ing a quoted param (handles @args)

names to avoid because wart uses them internally:
  anything ending in a digit - $vars expand to digit suffixes
  anything containing / - conflicts with param aliases

unary minus is problematic:
  -.3 => -0.3
  -.a => (- a)

ssyntax looks like infix but is subtly different:
  a. b => ((a) b), not (a b)
  (: a b) => (a b), not (compose a b) because ':' is the comment token

can't use coerce in eval

'int' converts floats to integers, but they're represented internally as 'long'
