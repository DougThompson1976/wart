can't use ':' for ssyntax since it's used early in the lisp reader.
can't compose *any* ssyntax with any package-interned symbol with a ':'; it confuses the reader.

inserting prn^ during debug requires a call-fn or call. still a single edit, though.
compose ssyntax in a lisp-2 seems useful only for function args.

can't use dot with functions before they're defined.

case-insensitive symbols. converting strings to syms loses information.

can't defover string because it's also a type. so we're stuck with a useless
function that can't handle symbols.

zap and or= multiply-eval their place.

intersperse checks types of args, something I want to avoid (by use of facilities like defgeneric).
