nested ,@ doesn't work yet: http://people.csail.mit.edu/alan/ftp/quasiquote-v59.ps.gz

can't always call macros with @args
macros need a special-cased eval to support @args
evalArgs != explicitly eval'ing a quoted param (handles @args)

names to avoid because wart uses them internally:
  anything ending in a digit - $vars expand to digit suffixes
  anything containing _ - match may misinterpret it
  anything containing / - conflicts with param aliases
  mac-withs - internal to the inliner

unary minus is problematic:
  -.3 => -0.3
  -.a => (- a)

can't use coerce in eval

'int' converts floats to integers, but they're represented internally as 'long'
