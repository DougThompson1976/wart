can't call macros with @args
spliceArgs assumes only macros quote the entire param list

names to avoid because wart uses them internally:
  anything ending in a digit - $vars expand to digit suffixes
  anything containing _ - match may misinterpret it
  mac-withs - internal to the inliner

can't use coerce in eval

'int' converts floats to integers, but they're represented internally as 'long'
