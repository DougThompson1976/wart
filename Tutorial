Any line with multiple words and no initial paren is a candidate for
paren-insertion. Later indented lines are included in the parens until an
unindented line. Empty lines are skipped when loading files.

Sometimes you'll want to continue a long literal list without inserting
parens. Insert one extra space of indent like so:

  (a b c
   d e f)
